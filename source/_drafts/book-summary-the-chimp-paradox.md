## Motivation  

I first heard of The Chimp Paradox when Dr. Steve Peters was invited as a guest on [Russell Howard's Good News](https://youtu.be/Wx0WHKSZE9Y?t=18m12s). His idea was simple - there's a chimp living in your mind which is responsible for your impulsive behavior and managing it is the key to becoming emotionally intelligent, happy, and successful. Intrigued, I decided to look further. A simple Google search led me to his TedX talk where he succinctly explains what his model is about to a group of students:

Convinced that this simplistic model is worth giving a try, I decided to read the book. This post is a detailed, chapter-by-chapter summary of the book.

## Chapter 1 - The Psychological Mind  

The book begins by explaining the three parts of the human brain that we'll be focusing on - the parietal lobe, the limbic lobe, and the frontal lobe. The limbic lobe is responsible for all our emotional reactions and this is where the Chimp lives. The frontal lobe is responsible for all our rational reactions and this is where the Human lives. The parietal lobe is responsible for speech, muscle coordination, etc. and this is the Computer. Both the Human and the Chimp have different modus operandi, agendas, and are in a perpetual competition over who gets to control the Computer.  

Controlling the Chimp is important because failing to do so would lead us to doing and saying things that we later regret. It is also important to control the Chimp because the body redirects blood supply to the dominant one - if we act irrationally the blood is sent to the limbic lobe (Chimp) and if we act rationally it is sent to the frontal lobe (Human). Also, by default, Chimp always overpowers the Human so it becomes imperative that we learn to control it. But remember that Chimp is neither good nor bad, it just is.  

*Towards the end of the chapter is a suggested exercise where you're asked to spend no more than 10 minutes a day looking back at the past 24 hours and trying to find out when the Chimp tried to hijack your thoughts and actions, and logging it in a journal. This becomes the first step where the Human is reprogramming the Computer by marking Chimp's actions as "not right", so to say.*   

## Chapter 2 - The Divided Planet (Part 1)  

The book introduces the idea of a psychological universe in Chapter 1. The psychological universe consists of seven planets, their moons, and a sun. The sun will shine brightest when all the seven planets are in harmony. Chapter 2 introduces the first planet and its moon - the Divided Planet and the Guiding Moon.  

The Divided Planet represents the perpetual battle between our rational (Human) and irrational (Chimp) selves. The Chimp is always more powerful than the Human and therefore the Human needs to know how to control it. The subsequent sections explain the differences between the Chimp and the Human by looking at four aspects - ways of thinking, agenda, ways of operating, and personality.  

### Ways of Thinking  

The Chimp and the Human interpret things differently. The Chimp relies on feelings and impressions and thinks emotionally. It may read between the lines, make assumptions, get paranoid and / or defensive. Thus, the interpretation of the Chimp is likely to be inaccurate. The Chimp's thinking is emotional. The Human, on the other hand, relies on facts and analyzes the situation before coming to any conclusions. The Human's thinking is logical.  

Both of these ways of thinking may lead to different interpretations of the same event. More often than not, these interpretations will differ and Chimp being the stronger one will win unless controlled.   

Emotional thinking makes the Chimp jump to conclusions. It reaches a conclusion and then looks for, and sometimes even twists, facts to back it up. It expects answers to complex situations to be in black-or-white instead of shades of grey. It has catastrophic thoughts where the slightest deviation from the expected outcome feels like the end of the world. It gets paranoid and stubbornly irrational. In short, the Chimp doesn't listen to reason.  

The Human, on the contrary, doesn't jump to conclusions and instead searches for evidence. It thinks rationally and puts things into context and perspective and realizes that complex situations in life do not have a black-and-white answer. Ironically, rational thinking is a prompt from the Chimp telling the Human that something is out of place.

### Agenda  

The Chimp's main agendas are procreation and survival. It has strong drives to fulfill these agendas. The other agendas the Chimp has include establishing territory, finding food, and finding shelter. All these agendas decide how the Chimp will act up.  

Humans, on the other hand, have varied agendas ranging from finding basic means to live to achieving self-fulfillment and working on self-development. One of the main agendas is establishing a society so that Humans can live in peace and comfort. Societal rules ensure equality, opportunity, and safety from other Chimps. A society also ensures justice, structure, and ethics. 

### Ways of Operating  

The Chimp operates like it is still living in the jungle. Its behavior will work well in the jungle but not so in a society. Problems arise when the Chimp tries to apply its jungle methods in a Human society. The most common jungle instinct is Fight-Flight-Freeze (FFF). Not addressing the FFF instinct leads to a rush of adrenalin in the body. For example, one might experience FFF before going on the stage. Adrenalin coupled with negative emotions leads to anxiety. Chimp also has strong drives like food, finding a mate, territory, finding a tribe, etc. Drives have strong reward pathways associated with them and that's why eating food is a feel-good experience. Both instincts and drives are powerful and natural but need to be controlled. Also, Chimps are vulnerable and insecure by nature and always on the lookout for danger.   

The Human operates like it is living in a society. Humans are considerate, compassionate, and show integrity. Humans also abide by the laws, both written and unwritten. Humans have to take responsibility for breaking the law and not blame the Chimp for everything. What really sets the Human apart from the Chimp is self-control. The Chimp acts on impulse and lacks emotional control where as the Human has the ability to control their impulses. Managing the impulse is one of the most important factors in determining success in life. This has been shown in the [Stanford Marshmallow experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0yhHKWUa0g).  

### Personality  

The Chimp could be a male or a female and will therefore have different emphasis on drives and instincts. In men, the emotional center of the brain has more right-sided connections where as in women it has more left-sided connections. This difference in how the brains are wired produces completely different sets of emotions in men and women.  

*Towards the end of the chapter is a suggested exercise which asks you to reflect at the past 24 hours and look at the happenings in your life and workout what the outcome would've been the outcome once if the Chimp handled the situation and once when the Human handled the situation.*
