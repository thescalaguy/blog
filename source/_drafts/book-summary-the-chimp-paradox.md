## Motivation  

I first heard of The Chimp Paradox when Dr. Steve Peters was invited as a guest on [Russell Howard's Good News](https://youtu.be/Wx0WHKSZE9Y?t=18m12s). His idea was simple - there's a chimp living in your mind which is responsible for your impulsive behavior and managing it is the key to becoming emotionally intelligent, happy, and successful. Intrigued, I decided to look further. A simple Google search led me to his TedX talk where he succinctly explains what his model is about to a group of students:

Convinced that this simplistic model is worth giving a try, I decided to read the book. This post is a detailed, chapter-by-chapter summary of the book.

## Chapter 1 - The Psychological Mind  

The book begins by explaining the three parts of the human brain that we'll be focusing on - the parietal lobe, the limbic lobe, and the frontal lobe. The limbic lobe is responsible for all our emotional reactions and this is where the Chimp lives. The frontal lobe is responsible for all our rational reactions and this is where the Human lives. The parietal lobe is responsible for speech, muscle coordination, etc. and this is the Computer. Both the Human and the Chimp have different modus operandi, agendas, and are in a perpetual competition over who gets to control the Computer.  

Controlling the Chimp is important because failing to do so would lead us to doing and saying things that we later regret. It is also important to control the Chimp because the body redirects blood supply to the dominant one - if we act irrationally the blood is sent to the limbic lobe (Chimp) and if we act rationally it is sent to the frontal lobe (Human). Also, by default, Chimp always overpowers the Human so it becomes imperative that we learn to control it. But remember that Chimp is neither good nor bad, it just is.  

Towards the end of the chapter is a suggested exercise where you're asked to spend no more than 10 minutes a day looking back at the past 24 hours and trying to find out when the Chimp tried to hijack your thoughts and actions, and logging it in a journal. This becomes the first step where the Human is reprogramming the Computer by marking Chimp's actions as "not right", so to say.
