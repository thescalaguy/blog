Hi there, reader. Thank you for stopping by.   

My name is Fasih Khatib (فصيح خطيب), classical Arabic for 'The Eloquent Speaker'. I am a software engineeer who likes to build new and exciting things. I've been creating software professionally for close to a decade, and a few more personally. I started programming in my school years when we were taught "turtle programming" with [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language). The love for programming stayed with me and led me to pursue a career in software engineering. In my tenure as an engineer, I've designed and built things like a realtime fraud detection and prevention engine, a couple of data platforms, and a few microservices.  

My interests range from algorithms to econometrics to software architecture; you'll find blog posts on all of these topics in my archives. I'm a Pythonista at heart but love programming in Clojure, too.

If you'd like to say hello, please drop me an email at hellofasih at pm dot me.
